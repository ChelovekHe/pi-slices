#Using I2C to control servos, LEDs and use PWM
#Setup

import i2c
servos = i2c.I2C()
#leds = i2c.I2C(frequency=1000)
=The i2c class will by default set frequency to 50Hz to work well with servo pulses. If you donâ€™t want to drive servos you can set it between 40 and 1000Hz to give more control and avoid flicker.

#Setting Speeds

servos.setSpeeds(100,-100)
#this will set the left motor (on led0) to full speed, and right motor (led1) to full reverse
servos.setSpeeds(50,50)
servos.setPWM(15,4095)
#this will set an LED on led15 to full brightness (on for 4095 ticks)
servos.setPWM(14,2048)  #set led14 to half brightness
