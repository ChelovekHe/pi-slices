# Pi Remote CAR

This is a DIY project for a Pi Car hobbyist (estimated build time)

## Step 1: Get a Chassis and Build it (2-4 hours)

Remote Car usin Sain smart chassis and can be bought on Amazon or SainSmart website http://www.sainsmart.com/ for about Â£6

## Step 3: Connect Pi and other sensors

TODO Hook up a Pi Zero to control as main processing unit and control of other cars components 

## Step 4,5,6,7 TODO
* Add camera

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/silvanmelchior/RPi_Cam_Web_Interface.git
  cd RPi_Cam_Web_Interface
  chmod u+x *.sh
  ./install.sh
  ```
* Add Tensorflow for AI and image recongnition
* Add Web Interface
* Add Sensors for Collision avoidance
